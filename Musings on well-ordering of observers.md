1. By definition, observers have to have memory to exist
2. Well-Ordering Principle: The well-ordering principle states that every set must have a least element in any non-empty subset under some order relation. For memory, this essentially implies that every piece of information has a defined position in a sequence. There’s always a "next" or "previous" state, which allows the informational states to be traversed and compared.
* Linear Ordering in Time: For memory to be meaningful, there needs to be a temporal sequence—a notion of "before" and "after." Memory allows us to differentiate moments, creating a linearly ordered record of states. This is what gives rise to the sensation of flow and also provides the basis for causality
* Because there are observers, and observers are needed to process information, well ordering needs to occur with memory
* Turing Analogy—Head Movement: Returning to the Turing machine analogy, the head of the Turing machine moves left or right on the tape. There’s no concept of the head being in two positions at once. The read-write process is sequential


If the universe is informational, and observers are needed to process information, and the process of observation (and computation) requires memory, and memory requires well ordering, then by definition the process requires some level of time.

Therefore, time is not just an external parameter; it is a necessary intrinsic structure for how information is processed and how observers experience reality. Without time (or something that functions as time), informational states couldn’t be ordered, meaning there would be no coherent memory, and thus no coherent observation or processing of information.

**The turing machine head as an observer**

The observer can be viewed as the specific trajectory that the Turing machine’s head takes across the tape.

-The path that the Turing machine’s head follows across the tape, step by step, represents the sequence of observations an observer makes.
-Each position on the tape corresponds to a specific informational state, and the movement from one position to the next mirrors how an observer processes and records a sequence of events or pieces of information.
-The trajectory is thus the history of where the head has been, or in the observer analogy, the series of past observations and interactions with the system.
The order in which the head moves matters because it determines the sequence of events the observer "sees." This creates the temporal structure needed for memory and coherent observation.
If the head were to move randomly or skip around, it would break the well-ordered sequence necessary for time-like progression, leading to incoherent or jumbled observations.
Similarly, an observer's memory is built from the ordered, step-by-step record of experiences, and this trajectory defines what the observer "remembers" and what they can infer from past states.
3. Causality and Time
The head’s movement gives rise to a sense of before and after, mirroring the flow of time for an observer. Each step forward in the trajectory is like moving forward in time, with new information being observed based on prior states.
In this way, the trajectory also reflects the observer’s perception of causality. Each new position is influenced by the previous state, much like how cause leads to effect in an observer's experience.
4. The Observer as the Path of Computation
If you think of the universe as a system that processes information (like the tape in a Turing machine), then the observer is not a static entity but the path of computation that unfolds as the machine (observer) moves through the informational states.
This suggests that the observer's identity is tied to the specific sequence of informational interactions it follows—its trajectory—rather than being an independent entity outside the flow of information.


**The Universe as turing machine heads interacting with other turing machine heads**

Im proposing a scenario where Turing machine heads (observers) are not processing a predefined set of universal "information" but are instead making sense of each other, which forms the relational structure of reality. In this framework, there isn't necessarily a fixed, objective "information tape" that all observers interact with. Instead, the entire structure of reality is built up from the interactions between observers themselves.

Reality emerges not from processing a fixed "tape" of universal data but from the network of interactions between these observers. Each observer is constantly making sense of the others, and their experience of reality is shaped by these mutual interactions. In this view, information is not an external resource to be processed; instead, it is created through the interactions of observers. 

 Since each observer’s reality is shaped by how they interact with others, each observer has a distinct and relative experience of reality. There is no single, objective truth; instead, truth and reality are relative to the perspective of each observer.

  In this model, observers are co-creating reality through their interactions. The more observers interact with each other, the more complex the reality becomes, as each observer brings their own interpretations and influences into the system.
