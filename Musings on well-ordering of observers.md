1. By definition, observers have to have memory to exist
2. Well-Ordering Principle: The well-ordering principle states that every set must have a least element in any non-empty subset under some order relation. For memory, this essentially implies that every piece of information has a defined position in a sequence. There’s always a "next" or "previous" state, which allows the informational states to be traversed and compared.
* Linear Ordering in Time: For memory to be meaningful, there needs to be a temporal sequence—a notion of "before" and "after." Memory allows us to differentiate moments, creating a linearly ordered record of states. This is what gives rise to the sensation of flow and also provides the basis for causality
* Because there are observers, and observers are needed to process information, well ordering needs to occur with memory
* Turing Analogy—Head Movement: Returning to the Turing machine analogy, the head of the Turing machine moves left or right on the tape. There’s no concept of the head being in two positions at once. The read-write process is sequential


If the universe is informational, and observers are needed to process information, and the process of observation (and computation) requires memory, and memory requires well ordering, then by definition the process requires some level of time.

Therefore, time is not just an external parameter; it is a necessary intrinsic structure for how information is processed and how observers experience reality. Without time (or something that functions as time), informational states couldn’t be ordered, meaning there would be no coherent memory, and thus no coherent observation or processing of information.
