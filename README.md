# Why is there something rather than nothing?

## The Universe as Information
There are many competing theories about what the universe is made of, and why and how it exists. Quantum mechanics, general relativity, string theory—all these frameworks offer different perspectives. Yet, despite their differences, they share a fundamental agreement: information lies at the core of how we understand reality.

- **Particles** have properties such as position, momentum, spin, and charge—all pieces of information that distinguish one particle from another.
- **Entanglement** is a phenomenon where particles become linked, and the state of one instantaneously influences the state of another, regardless of distance. This non-local behavior suggests that information is a fundamental aspect of the universe, transcending classical concepts of space and time.
- In **general relativity**, information is encoded in the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. The geometry of the universe conveys information about gravitational fields and the distribution of matter.
- **Black hole thermodynamics** introduces the concept of entropy proportional to the event horizon's area, suggesting that information about all the matter that has fallen into a black hole is encoded on its surface. This leads to the holographic principle, which posits that all the information contained within a volume of space can be represented as information on the boundary of that space.

No matter how we attempt to frame the fundamental nature of the universe (whether through energy, consciousness, fields, or mathematics), each of these frameworks ultimately requires information to be processed, differentiated, and understood. 

## Reframing the Question: Why is there information?
We can thus rephrase the question "Why is there something rather than nothing?" into a more precise "How and why is there information rather than no information? 

In order to attempt to formulate an answer to this question, we need to be precise on what information is and the conditions on which it may arise. 

## What is Information?

In a nutshell, information exists when one state can be identified as distinct from another. Without the ability to make such distinctions, no information can be conveyed. More specifically, the following criteria must be met:

### 1. Multiple Distinguishable States must be identified 
There must be more than one possible state that can be differentiated. Information arises when these states are distinguishable in some observable or meaningful way. For example, a light switch has two possible states: "on" and "off." These states are distinct because they produce different effects—light or darkness. If only one state existed, no information could be conveyed because there would be nothing to compare.  

### 2. There must be a common basis to make any distinction 
For the distinction between states to be meaningful, the states must share a common basis within the same system. This commonality provides the framework that allows the states to be compared and understood in relation to each other. For example, in the light switch system, both "on" and "off" pertain to the function of controlling light. They are distinguishable within this shared framework of light control, and it is this commonality that enables the comparison between these states. States outside this framework (e.g., the color of the switch) do not contribute to the informational content in this context.

### 3.The system must have boundaries, which define what is possible; As such there must be some set of non-disguishable and non-Possible States 
The system must differentiate between states (that are distinguishable) that "can occur", and those that are non distinguishable, or outside of the realm of possibilities. In the light switch example, the states "on" and "off" are possible, whereas a state like "half-on" or "floating" is non-possible. Non-possible states are irrelevant to the system and fall outside its scope; furthermore they can be considered indistinguishable from the perspective of the system alone. 

## Information requires multiple states of comparison: Enter the Role of the Observer

Information is viewed and interpreted via an observer who has the:

**Ability to Differentiate**
The observer must have the inherent ability to make distinctions—whether through sensory perception, measurement, or conceptual analysis. This capability to differentiate between various states is what gives rise to information. Think of the observer as a function capable of outputting distinct values.

**Comparison Across Multiple States**
Information only becomes meaningful if the observer can compare multiple states. It’s not enough to observe a single state; the value of information emerges from the relationship between distinguishable states. Without multiple states to compare, the observer cannot produce any informational content.

**Unique Perspective on Indistinguishability**
What differentiates observers is their individual perspective on what is indistinguishable or "not possible" within a system. Each observer has their own set of differentiable constraints that defines what distinctions they can make and what is beyond their capacity to perceive or differentiate.

To be clear: The observer’s constraints and imperfections are what shape and limit the ability to distinguish between states.  For example, a person with limited color vision may be unable to distinguish between certain shades of color that others can easily differentiate. This constraint directly limits their ability to perceive the full range of possible states within the system of color perception. The more limited or constrained the observer is, the fewer distinctions they can make. In this way, their ability to differentiate is dependent directly on the state itself

**Observers are information themselves**
Observers Have Distinguishable States; specifically the indistinguishable sections in a level 

With these definitions in mind, then the challenge is understanding how information might "emerge" in the first place 

## Thought Experiment: Let's assume that there is _no_ information in a universe 

Consider a world with no information. In such a universe, there is no space or time, no matter or energy, no forces or interactions. Everything is homogenous; every point is identical to every other point. Going back to our original definitions, this universe is non-distinguishable, does not have multiple possible states, and has no common basis for distinction.

If this universe is non-distinguishable, then by definition it can be conceptually "cut" into multiple "slices", which are both non-distinct from each of the slices, as well as non-disctinct from the whole. These arbitrary cuts provide a way to break up the infinite sameness into subunits or frames that, while still homogenous, create the possibility for comparison.

- **Emerging Reference Frames**: As soon as you make arbitrary cuts, you create the potential for an observer, because an observer is a reference frame of indistinguishability within the universe. Even though the slices are indistinguishable at first, the fact that multiple slices exist means that an observer can emerge who is associated with one of those slices.
  
  These observers arise when some form of local reference (a particular cut or slice) begins to distinguish itself relative to other slices. The observer's imperfections allow them to perceive differences or relationships between these arbitrary slices, even if those distinctions don’t inherently exist in the original uniformity.
  
- **Constraints as a Basis for Perception**: Even in a uniform universe, observers can arise because of their own constraints. These constraints (such as limited perception, sensory limitations, or finite resolution) cause them to interpret the arbitrary cuts as distinct. The observers cannot perceive the totality of the universe’s uniformity and instead impose their own limitations on it, leading to differentiations that only they can perceive.

In essence, observers exist within the arbitrary slices and interpret them based on their own incomplete ability to interact with the whole universe. These imperfections are what force them to create distinctions, and these distinctions are what lead to the perception of information.

Differentiation within an Indistinguishable Set: The Infinite Potential for Distinction
The core idea here is that in a perfectly homogenous set—a set where every point is indistinguishable from every other point—we can make infinite arbitrary divisions without these divisions altering the intrinsic homogeneity of the set. This means that, by definition, any number of cuts can be made, and these cuts do not create fundamentally different parts, but rather highlight relationships that were latent in the original whole. In different contexts, these arbitrary cuts can produce distinguishable features, without the overall uniformity being disturbed.

**Information MUST arise from no information**

[To be built out]

**Measurement as an Interaction Between Distinct Frames of Indistinguishability**

When we think about observation or measurement, traditionally, we might think of a passive process where an observer simply detects or records the state of a system. However, if we reframe observers as entities with unique "frames of indistinguishability," then measurement becomes an active interaction between these frames.

******Distinct Frames Collide to Create Distinction; in other words, information must arise from no information, in an infinite universe**

Consider two observers, Observer A and Observer B, each with their own frame of indistinguishability. Within their own frames, certain aspects of the universe are inherently indistinguishable to them—meaning they cannot perceive the differences.
When Observer A interacts with Observer B (or with the system observed by Observer B), what occurs is that each observer brings their unique perspective or their unique capacity to distinguish into the interaction. This means that the overlap or intersection of these two distinct frames becomes an area of potential differentiation.
Measurement, then, is the process by which these interactions resolve what was previously indistinguishable within either frame alone. It’s through the comparison and interaction between two different sets of constraints and capabilities that new distinctions (i.e., information) emerge.


Mathematical Representation and Observer-Dependent Cuts
The example of arbitrary cuts in a homogenous set can also be well understood through mathematical concepts like symmetry breaking and higher-dimensional projections. In the mathematical sense, a perfectly symmetrical object can have infinite lines of symmetry, but none of these lines alter the symmetry itself. The lines are simply ways of imposing a relational understanding of different parts of the object.

One useful analogy here is the notion of projections from higher dimensions to lower dimensions. Imagine a four-dimensional object projected into three-dimensional space. The original four-dimensional object is homogeneous in a certain sense that transcends our three-dimensional perspective. When it is projected, we perceive it as divided into various three-dimensional shadows, which are inherently less complete representations of the original. Each shadow is distinguishable in its form and properties, yet none of them fully encapsulates the essence of the higher-dimensional object. Observers who perceive these projections naturally differentiate between them, even though these differences emerge due to their dimensional limitations.

The infinite cuts in a homogenous set serve as similar projections—arbitrary distinctions that do not fully represent the original's true form but that gain meaning through contextual interpretation by an observer. Observers, operating with their own constraints and limited perspectives, draw meaningful lines, creating a framework within which to perceive and engage with an otherwise undifferentiated reality.

**Conclusion: The Paradox of Differentiation in a Homogenous Universe**
In summary, the homogenous universe can be understood as containing infinite latent possibilities for differentiation, and observers arise as natural agents who actualize these distinctions. The key to understanding why there is "something" rather than "nothing" lies in recognizing that the "something" emerges not because the original state is unstable or incomplete, but because observers, by nature of their own limitations, impose a contextual framework on an otherwise undifferentiated potential.

This act of imposing distinctions does not alter the underlying homogeneity. Instead, it highlights relationships and partitions that were always possible but never actualized until framed by an observer's contextual view. Differentiation, therefore, is fundamentally about drawing infinite, context-dependent cuts within a homogenous set—creating something distinguishable without ever changing the essence of the original undifferentiated whole. This results in an emergent "something"—a universe filled with information, structure, and complexity, all of which is deeply tied to the observer's unique vantage point and the distinctions they make within an otherwise continuous and undistinguished field of potential.

### Appendix: Mathematical Examples on How Differences Can Emerge:

- **Legendre's Three Squares Theorem**: Legendre's Three Squares Theorem states that a natural number n can be expressed as the sum of three integer squares if and only if n is not of the form n=4^a(8b+7), where a and b are non-negative integers. This theorem highlights that in three-dimensional space, certain numbers cannot be represented as the sum of three squares due to inherent mathematical constraints.
  
  **Example**: The number 7 cannot be expressed as the sum of three squares because it fits the form n=4^0(8 × 0 + 7) = 7. However, the number 6 can be expressed as 6=1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2.

- **Lagrange's Four Squares Theorem**: In contrast, Lagrange's Four Squares Theorem asserts that every natural number can be expressed as the sum of four integer squares. This difference between three-dimensional and four-dimensional representations introduces a natural distinction based solely on dimensionality.
  
  **Implication**: The inability to represent certain numbers as the sum of three squares in 3D, but the ability to do so in 4D, creates a differentiation. This difference is information that arises naturally from the properties of numbers and dimensions.
