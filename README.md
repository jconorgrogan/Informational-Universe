# Why is there something rather than nothing?

## Introduction: What is Information?
Information fundamentally involves the ability to recognize and distinguish between different states within a system. It exists when one state can be identified as distinct from another. Without the ability to make such distinctions, no information can be conveyed. For information to exist, the following conditions must be met:

### Multiple Distinguishable States
There must be more than one possible state that can be differentiated. Information arises when these states are distinguishable in some observable or meaningful way. For example, a light switch has two possible states: "on" and "off." These states are distinct because they produce different effects—light or darkness. If only one state existed, no information could be conveyed because there would be nothing to compare. The essence of information lies in this ability to differentiate between distinct states.

### Common Basis for Distinction
For the distinction between states to be meaningful, the states must share a common basis within the same system. This commonality provides the framework that allows the states to be compared and understood in relation to each other. For example, in the light switch system, both "on" and "off" pertain to the function of controlling light. They are distinguishable within this shared framework of light control, and it is this commonality that enables the comparison between these states. States outside this framework (e.g., the color of the switch) do not contribute to the informational content in this context.

### Distinguishing Possible from Non-Possible States
In addition to being distinguishable, the states must be possible within the system's defined boundaries. The system must differentiate between states that can occur and those that cannot. In the light switch example, the states "on" and "off" are possible, whereas a state like "half-on" or "floating" is non-possible. Non-possible states are irrelevant to the system and fall outside its scope. Defining what is possible within the system helps set its informational boundaries—information can only be carried by states that are valid within the system.

## The Role of the Observer
In order to have information in the first place, it necessitates having a “vessel” within the system that is assessing the system and “processing the information”.

The observer can be thought of as having two key characteristics:

### Ability to Distinguish Between States
The observer must be able to recognize or differentiate between different states of the system. This could involve physical measurements, sensory perception, or conceptual recognition of distinctions (e.g., a scientist observing a physical phenomenon or a sensor distinguishing between temperature levels).

### Subject to its Own Constraints and Imperfections
An observer operates within its own framework of constraints and limitations, which may result in imperfect information. These constraints could be due to limitations in sensory abilities, measurement tools, knowledge, or conceptual understanding. No observer is perfectly omniscient; their view of the system is always partial or incomplete.

#### Notably
The observer’s constraints and imperfections (characteristic 2) are what shape and limit the ability to distinguish between states (characteristic 1). For example, a person with limited color vision may be unable to distinguish between certain shades of color that others can easily differentiate. This constraint directly limits their ability to perceive the full range of possible states within the system of color perception. The more limited or constrained the observer is, the fewer distinctions they can make. In this way, characteristic 2 directly leads to, and defines, characteristic 1.

### Information Depends on the Ability to Distinguish States
For information to exist, different states must be distinguished, and this can only happen if there's an observer with the ability to recognize those distinctions. Without an observer to perceive differences between possible states, information, in a meaningful sense, does not arise. For instance, consider how a thermostat reading only becomes meaningful when someone interprets the temperature as 'hot' or 'cold.' Without that observer, the distinction between temperature levels lacks any informational context. The existence of information is tied to the presence of an observer who can make sense of it.

### The Observer's Imperfections Shape Information
The observer’s limitations (imperfect senses, tools, or knowledge) play a crucial role in shaping what information is perceived. Since no observer is omniscient or perfect, the distinctions they draw are shaped by their constraints. These constraints might lead to partial or incomplete information, but nonetheless, they create the structure through which the observer perceives reality. This means that what we call "information" is not an objective feature of the universe alone but is influenced by the observer's subjective framework.

### Information is Relative to the Observer's Capabilities
The key idea is that information isn't an independent feature that exists regardless of observation—it arises when an observer interprets or measures differences. The very act of observation introduces distinctions, and these distinctions depend on the observer's ability to process them. In a universe with absolute uniformity (no differences), information would only exist for an observer due to their limitations—essentially, they would impose structure on a homogenous world.

## The Universe as Information
There are many competing frameworks which attempt to describe reality: quantum mechanics, general relativity, string theory etc. The one thing they all agree on? All are united in that they rely on information to describe reality, at every layer of complexity:

- **Particles** have properties such as position, momentum, spin, and charge—all pieces of information that distinguish one particle from another.
- **Entanglement** is a phenomenon where particles become linked, and the state of one instantaneously influences the state of another, regardless of distance. This non-local behavior suggests that information is a fundamental aspect of the universe, transcending classical concepts of space and time.
- In **general relativity**, information is encoded in the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. The geometry of the universe conveys information about gravitational fields and the distribution of matter.
- **Black hole thermodynamics** introduces the concept of entropy proportional to the event horizon's area, suggesting that information about all the matter that has fallen into a black hole is encoded on its surface. This leads to the holographic principle, which posits that all the information contained within a volume of space can be represented as information on the boundary of that space.

As such, to understand reality, we must observe, measure, and process data—this is information. So, it stands to reason that the universe must enable information.

## Reframing the Question: Why Information?
If everything boils down to information, then the question "Why is there something rather than nothing?" becomes "Why is there information rather than no information?"

## A World Without Information
To understand how information emerges, consider a world with no information—a state of absolute uniformity and non-distinction. In such a state, there is no space or time, no matter or energy, no forces or interactions. Everything is homogenous; every point is identical to every other point. Going back to our original definitions, this universe is non-distinguishable, does not have multiple possible states, and has no common basis for distinction.

In this theoretical universe, there are no discernible differences between states—everything appears identical or homogenous. If we assume the universe itself contains no inherent distinctions or differences (no change in space, time, or matter), then, in principle, it has no informational content on its own because information requires distinguishable states. In such a universe, without observers, it would be impossible to detect any differences because there are none to detect.

Even though the universe itself is perfectly indistinguishable, the imperfections of the observers would create a kind of distinction, but only relative to them. This means that:

- The observers’ own limitations and imperfections would lead them to perceive or imagine distinctions where none exist. In this way, the observers would reveal information, not from the universe itself, but from their own constraints interacting with the universe.
- These constraints effectively create information for the observer, as they would experience differences based on what they are unable to observe, detect, or process.

In a universe with no inherent differences, information would only exist for the observer because their constraints or imperfections force them to distinguish between things, even when there’s nothing inherently distinct in the universe itself.

This means the act of observation (imperfect by definition) creates information. The observers themselves impose structure, distinguishing features, and meaning due to their inability to fully comprehend or interact with the homogenous universe.

An observer can be understood as a kind of reference frame that is defined by its imperfections relative to the system (or reference frame) it is observing.

## Arbitrary Cuts in a Non-Distinguishable World (How Observers Might Arise)
In a world with absolute uniformity—a state where there are no inherent distinctions or differences—nothing is distinguishable. This means there is no informational content because information requires differences between states. However, this section explores how, despite the uniformity, distinctions might still emerge through arbitrary cuts.

Specifically, observers arise as a natural consequence of all possible cuts (or distinctions) in an otherwise indistinguishable void. Imagine making random slices through a uniformly colored cake—although all pieces might look the same, the act of cutting creates individual segments. Similarly, arbitrary cuts in a uniform universe create the potential for differentiation, even if the pieces initially appear identical.

### What are Arbitrary Cuts?
An arbitrary cut is a conceptual slice through this undifferentiated reality. It doesn’t yet imply meaningful distinctions but represents a division or partition of the uniform space into multiple sections, even if these sections are still indistinguishable from one another.

Imagine the universe as a vast, continuous hypercube of sameness—each segment of this hypercube represents a valid slice of the universe, but each slice remains indistinguishable from the others.

These arbitrary cuts provide a way to break up the infinite sameness into subunits or frames that, while still homogenous, create the possibility for comparison.

### How Observers Arise from Arbitrary Cuts:
- **Emerging Reference Frames**: As soon as you make arbitrary cuts, you create the potential for an observer, because an observer is a reference frame within the universe. Even though the slices are indistinguishable at first, the fact that multiple slices exist means that an observer can emerge who is associated with one of those slices.
  
  These observers arise when some form of local reference (a particular cut or slice) begins to distinguish itself relative to other slices. The observer's imperfections allow them to perceive differences or relationships between these arbitrary slices, even if those distinctions don’t inherently exist in the original uniformity.
  
- **Constraints as a Basis for Perception**: Even in a uniform universe, observers can arise because of their own constraints. These constraints (such as limited perception, sensory limitations, or finite resolution) cause them to interpret the arbitrary cuts as distinct. The observers cannot perceive the totality of the universe’s uniformity and instead impose their own limitations on it, leading to differentiations that only they can perceive.

In essence, observers exist within the arbitrary slices and interpret them based on their own incomplete ability to interact with the whole universe. These imperfections are what force them to create distinctions, and these distinctions are what lead to the perception of information.

### Mathematical Examples on How Differences Can Emerge:
- **Dimensional Differences and Representation of Numbers**: The properties of mathematical objects can vary significantly across different dimensions, leading to natural distinctions that emerge from the underlying symmetry of space.

- **Legendre's Three Squares Theorem**: Legendre's Three Squares Theorem states that a natural number n can be expressed as the sum of three integer squares if and only if n is not of the form n=4^a(8b+7), where a and b are non-negative integers. This theorem highlights that in three-dimensional space, certain numbers cannot be represented as the sum of three squares due to inherent mathematical constraints.
  
  **Example**: The number 7 cannot be expressed as the sum of three squares because it fits the form n=4^0(8 × 0 + 7) = 7. However, the number 6 can be expressed as 6=1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2.

- **Lagrange's Four Squares Theorem**: In contrast, Lagrange's Four Squares Theorem asserts that every natural number can be expressed as the sum of four integer squares. This difference between three-dimensional and four-dimensional representations introduces a natural distinction based solely on dimensionality.
  
  **Implication**: The inability to represent certain numbers as the sum of three squares in 3D, but the ability to do so in 4D, creates a differentiation. This difference is information that arises naturally from the properties of numbers and dimensions.

- **Symmetry and Symmetry Breaking**: Symmetry in mathematics often implies a state of uniformity or indistinguishability. However, when symmetry is broken, distinctions emerge.
  
  - **Group Theory and Symmetry Groups**: In group theory, symmetry groups describe the symmetries of mathematical objects. Breaking symmetry by applying specific operations can lead to different group structures, introducing distinguishability.
  
    **Example**: A perfect sphere has continuous rotational symmetry. Introducing a deformation (a specific cut) breaks this symmetry, resulting in an object like an ellipsoid, which has distinguishable properties and less symmetry.
  
- **Topology and the Emergence of Holes**: In topology, altering the structure of a space can introduce features like holes, which are topologically significant and introduce new information.
  
  **Example**: **Homotopy Groups**: The fundamental group (first homotopy group) captures information about the loops in a space. A sphere and a torus are both two-dimensional surfaces, but the torus has a non-trivial fundamental group due to its hole, distinguishing it from the sphere.
  
  **Implication**: The introduction of holes (specific cuts) in a continuous surface creates topological distinctions, leading to different classifications of spaces and thus generating information.

### Mathematical Constructs from Uniformity:
Starting from a state of mathematical uniformity, specific definitions and axioms introduce distinctions.

- **Set Theory and Cardinality**: Considering the set of all real numbers between 0 and 1, it's a continuous, uniform set. However, by defining rational and irrational numbers within this interval, we introduce a distinction based on number properties.
  
  **Implication**: The density of rational numbers differs from that of irrational numbers, and this distinction provides information about the structure of the real number line.

### Implications for the Emergence of Information
These mathematical examples illustrate how distinctions naturally arise from uniformity due to inherent properties and constraints within mathematical systems. The differences in dimensional capabilities, symmetry properties, and topological features introduce distinguishability without external intervention.

## The Inevitable Emergence of the Universe
Once distinguishability becomes possible, information inevitably follows. With information comes somethingness—the existence of entities that can be differentiated and observed. The universe, filled with matter, energy, and intricate structures, is the result of distinctions drawn from non-distinction.

This perspective suggests that the emergence of the universe was not just possible but inevitable once the conditions allowed for distinguishability. The fundamental laws of physics, which govern how distinctions arise and evolve, ensure that information will emerge from a state of uniformity.

- Specific cuts introduce real, distinguishable differences that define the emergence of information.
- Symmetry breaking, dimensional constraints, and topology all contribute to the transition from uniformity to distinguishability, leading to the creation of informational content.
- Once specific distinctions arise, observers can now perceive and process these differences, interacting with the universe in a way that allows for the structured observation of reality.

### Example: Dimensional Cuts and Constraints
Imagine a universe where objects and information exist in higher dimensions (like 4D), but the observer exists in a lower dimension (like 3D). The cuts or distinctions that are naturally describable and fully coherent in the higher dimension may become incomplete or difficult to describe in the lower dimension.

For example: In 3D space, there are limits to what can be represented compared to 4D space. Some shapes, phenomena, or relationships that exist naturally in 4D cannot be fully captured or understood by a 3D observer. One way to think about this is through the analogy of shadows: a 3D object casts a 2D shadow, and while the shadow is a projection of the 3D object, it doesn’t contain all the information about that object.

Similarly, a "cut" in 3D might be a projection of a more complex 4D shape or system, but the 3D observer can only grasp part of it, leaving important information inaccessible.

### Dimensional Constraints on the Observer
An observer in a lower-dimensional space (like 3D) is inherently limited by the properties of that space. They cannot fully comprehend phenomena that are "higher-dimensional" or complex, because their perception is restricted by the lower-dimensional framework in which they exist.

Certain mathematical theorems illustrate how some phenomena can only be fully expressed in higher dimensions. Legendre's Three Squares Theorem shows that some numbers (like 7) cannot be represented as the sum of three squares, but if you move to a higher dimension (4D), Lagrange's Four Squares Theorem says that any number can be represented as the sum of four squares. So, the observer in 3D has a constraint that prevents them from seeing certain solutions or relationships that are obvious in 4D.

This dimensional constraint means that the 3D observer perceives partial or incomplete information because their perception is limited by their dimensional framework. In higher dimensions, the information might be fully describable and coherent, but to the 3D observer, it is either missing, distorted, or impossible to grasp.

### The Role of Cuts in Creating Information
Now, when arbitrary cuts are made in higher dimensions, the observer in 3D might perceive these cuts in a limited way. This perception is incomplete because the cuts themselves (the distinctions or divisions made in 4D) are only partially visible in 3D. The 3D observer’s dimensional constraint results in a loss of information.

Because of this, the observer creates a "something"—a limited or simplified version of the full reality based on what they can perceive. They construct their understanding of reality within the framework of their own dimensional constraints. In this way:

- The information they perceive (the structure, differences, and distinctions) is inherently limited, but it forms the basis of their "reality." The constraints of the dimension they inhabit shape their perception and understanding, creating an informational boundary around what they can and cannot observe.

### Observers' Constraints as Information Creators
This dimensional limitation is a perfect example of how observers’ constraints lead to the creation of information:

- In higher dimensions (like 4D), the universe may be fully describable and coherent, with no missing pieces.
- In lower dimensions (like 3D), the observer experiences a reduction of information due to their dimensional limitations. This means they cannot fully comprehend or represent certain phenomena that exist in higher dimensions.
- This constraint forces the observer to distinguish between what is observable and what is not, thereby generating information that is specific to their limited perspective. They are effectively "cut off" from a higher reality, and the "somethingness" they observe is a product of their limited ability to grasp the full picture.
